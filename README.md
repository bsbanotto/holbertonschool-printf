# <center>A simple rebuild of *printf()*

## <center> Purpose

This project was assigned to us by Holberton School Tulsa. The mandatory goals/functionality/restrictions of this project for our *printf()* (i.e. *_printf()*) were as follows:
- Use the prototype: *int _printf(const char *format, ...);*
- Print all of format to std output and handle the conversion specifiers: "c", "s", "%", "d", and "i"
- Returns the number of characters printed
- written in vi, vim, or emacs
- compiled with the following `gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89 -Wno-format *.c`
